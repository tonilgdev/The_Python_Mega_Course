# Tip 1 - Printing Multiple Variables 

- It is also possible to print out multiple variables in one single print function by using commas between the variables.

# Tip 2 - Using Comments 

- You can add comments to your code by starting with a # symbol as shown above.

- The text after the # symbol is ignored by the Python interpreter. The comment only serves as information for the programmer. You can write comments above those lines of code for which you feel there should be some extra clarification to make your code easier to understand.

# Did you know?

- Python got his name not from the snake, but from Monty Python's Flying Circus, a favorite comedy series of Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.
- Did you know that Python was first released in 1991? Python 2 was released in 2000, and Python 3 (the current version) in 2008.


# Cheatsheet: Data Types

In this section, you learned that:

 - Integers are used to represent whole numbers:

> rank = 10
> eggs = 12
> people = 3

- Floats represent decimal numbers:

> temperature = 10.2
> rainfall = 5.98
> elevation = 1031.88

- Strings represent text:

> message = "Welcome to our online shop!"
> name = "John"
> serial = "R001991981SW"

- Lists represent arrays of values that may change during the course of the program:

> members = ["Sim Soony", "Marry Roundknee", "Jack Corridor"]
> pixel_values = [252, 251, 251, 253, 250, 248, 247]

- Dictionaries represent pairs of keys and values:

> phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+37682929928", "Marry Simpons": "+423998200919"}
> volcano_elevations = {"Glacier Peak": 3213.9, "Rainer": 4392.1}

- Keys of a dictionary can be extracted with:

> phone_numbers.keys()

- Values of a dictionary can be extracted with:

> phone_numbers.values()

- Tuples represent arrays of values that are not to be changed during the course of the program:

> vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
> one_digits = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

- You can get a list of attributes of a data type has using:

> dir(str)
> dir(list)
> dir(dict)

- You can get a list of Python builtin functions using:

> dir(__builtins__)

- You can get the documentation of a Python data type using:

> help(str)
> help(str.replace)
> help(dict.values)
